# 📊 Final Project: PISA Career Expectations Analysis

This project is part of the course **DATA 824 KUMC**. It explores how school socioeconomic status (SCHSES), and gender relate to students' Expected Occupational Status (EOS) using the **PISA 2022 dataset** for Latin American countries.

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Investigate differences in career expectations by Latin American country.
- Analyze the influence of **school SES**, **school type**, and **gender** on EOS.
- Visualize data using **violin plots** and **correlation matrices**.
- Build an interactive **Shiny app** to explore the data.

## 🔧 Key Steps
- Filtered PISA data to Latin American countries.
- Created a new school-level SES variable (`schescs`).
- Cleaned and recoded gender and school type variables.
- Used `W_FSTUWT` to apply student-level weights.
- Developed an interactive **Shiny app** with filtering options.

## ▶️ How to Run
